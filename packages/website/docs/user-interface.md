42Pen's user interface is made to feel simple and accessible so that you have all the required things at your tips and still doesn't look cluttered for someone using it for first time.

## Code Panes

Code panes are the actually sections where you write your code. You get 3 panes, one for HTML, CSS & JavaScript each.

## Preview

Alongside the code panes, is a white (by default) area where you see the preview of your code. Its an iframe that is feeded your HTML, CSS & JavaScript as you type to generate realtime preview.

## Title

On the top-left side you can see the title of your creation. Click on it to edit it anytime.

## Create New, Save or Open a creation

On the top-right side, you have the 3 buttons to create a new creation or save an open one. Also you can access all your saved creations from the _Saved Creations Pane_ by clicking the _Open_ button.

From the _Saved Creations Pane_ you can also export or import all your creations at once. Exporting generates a JSON file which you can backup in your Google Drive, Dropbox etc.

## Settings

## Changelog

Besides the Settings button, is the Changelog button where you can read all the changes in the app for each release version.

## Layouts

Next you have some layout options to choose from. Select whats suits you best. This setting is saved per creation basis, so each of your creation can show in a different layout that you see best for it.

## Download/Share creation
